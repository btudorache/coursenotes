# CourseNotes

An android app used for organizing and writing course notes. 

Instead of using usual notes apps, this project makes it easier to setup notes for courses divided by weeks. 
It is specifically built for the courses system at my university, but it can certainly be used for every type 
of course lasting one or more academic terms.

It was built with [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) components and 
uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce Kotlin coding styles.

## Setup

This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the ```gradlew build``` command 
or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
